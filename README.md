## Prerequisites
- Local shell with Azure CLI installed or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#cloudshell/)
- Azure Subscription, on which you are able to create resources and assign permissions
  - View your subscription using ```az account show``` 
  - If you don't have an account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).  

## Getting Started
### Fork the repository

1.  Fork the repository by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top right of the page.
This creates a local copy of the repository for you to work in. 

2.  Run "azd init" to initialize your project. 
  - select empty template
  - supply an environment name. Can be anything. I use "tsn106"
  - pick a region
  - supply an Azure subscription

3. Run "azd provision" to provision the Azure resources.  
  
4. After running azd init, the azure.yaml file is also added to the root of your project. Think of azure.yaml as the appâ€™s user manual for azd. azd refers to this file to learn more about the app so that it knows, for instance, what Azure service will be hosting your app, how to build and deploy your app.

5. Finally, deploy the app by running: "azd deploy".
